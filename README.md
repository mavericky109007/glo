# OTA SMS Testing Environment

## Educational and Research Disclaimer

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This project is for educational and research purposes only.**

This testing environment is designed to help security researchers, telecommunications professionals, and students understand:
- OTA (Over-The-Air) SMS vulnerabilities
- Cellular network security mechanisms
- SIM card applet management
- Mobile network infrastructure

**DO NOT use this environment for malicious purposes or against systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.**

## Overview

This comprehensive testing environment simulates a complete mobile network infrastructure capable of sending OTA SMS messages for applet installation and deletion. It recreates the conditions necessary to study vulnerabilities like Simjacker and other OTA-based attacks in a controlled, isolated environment.
